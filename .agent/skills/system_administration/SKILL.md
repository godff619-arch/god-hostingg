# System Administration Guide

Docklift includes built-in system management features accessible through the UI and API.

## System Dashboard (`/system`)

The system page shows real-time server health metrics:
- **CPU**: Usage percentage, model, core count, temperature
- **Memory**: Used/total/percentage (reads host `/proc/meminfo` for accuracy)
- **GPU**: Model, VRAM, temperature, utilization (if available)
- **Disk**: Mount points, used/total/percentage
- **Network**: Bytes sent/received, speeds
- **Processes**: Top 10 by CPU (uses `nsenter` to read host processes)
- **Server Info**: Hostname, distro, kernel, uptime, public IP, location

### API Endpoints
| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `GET /api/system/stats` | Full system metrics (3s cache) |
| `GET /api/system/quick` | CPU + memory only (for header widget) |
| `GET /api/system/ip` | Server's public IP (5-min cache) |

## Maintenance Operations

### Purge Resources
**API**: `POST /api/system/purge`

**DockLift-scoped only.** Requires **password step-up** (`requireStepUpPassword` / body `password`).

What it does (step-up required):
1. **409** if any deployment is `in_progress` before mutations (and again before image cleanup if a deploy raced in)
2. Remove unused `docklift-*` app tags outside each project’s keep-2 set (last 2 success `image_tags` + in-use container refs)
3. `docker builder prune -af` unless a deploy is in progress after image cleanup (skip `-af` rather than wipe live build cache)
4. Return real counts in `details[]`

What it must **never** do from the panel:
- `docker system prune` / delete non-`docklift-*` images
- Restart foreign containers
- Swap cycling, `drop_caches`, journal vacuum, apt clean, `/tmp` wipe

**Related automatic hygiene:** after successful deploy only — keep-2 project images + `builder prune -f` (unused). Failed deploy does not strip the last good release. Project → Deployments → **Restore** (step-up) pairs with keep-2.

UI copy: “unused Docklift images + clear BuildKit cache” — not “dangling only” / no-op.

Load averages on `/api/system/stats` come from real `os.loadavg()` — never fabricated load5/load15.

### Server Control

| API | Purpose | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `POST /api/system/reboot` | Reboot the host server | Uses `reboot -f`, simulated on Windows/Mac |
| `POST /api/system/reset` | Restart all Docklift containers | `docker restart` on `CORE_CONTAINERS` (all 5) |
| `POST /api/system/update-system` | Run `apt update && upgrade` on host | Via `nsenter`, 15-min timeout |
| `POST /api/system/upgrade` | Run Docklift upgrade script | Executes `/opt/docklift/upgrade.sh` on host |

## Interactive Web Terminal

**Route**: `/terminal`
**WebSocket**: `ws://host:8000/ws/terminal` (proxied via Nginx `/ws/`)

A full-featured xterm.js-based interactive terminal providing direct root access to the host.

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: xterm.js + WebSocket
- **Backend**: `ws` server + `child_process.spawn('script', ...)`
- **PTY**: Uses Linux `script` command for TTY emulation (zero native dependencies)
- **Container**: Runs inside `docklift-backend` (Alpine) but has host access via Docker privileged mode & PID host.

### Features
- **Real-time PTY**: Supports tab completion, history, colors, ncurses (htop/nano).
- **Root Access**: Session starts in `/root` with full host privileges.
- **Host strip UI** (`TerminalView`): quiet text actions above the shell — update packages, upgrade Docklift, purge unused Docklift images + BuildKit, reset stack, reboot. No rainbow action cards; shell chrome follows light/dark theme.
- **Upgrade / package dialogs**: Confirm first (panel goes offline; Docklift upgrade shows Now → Installing version + password on the same dialog; wrong password re-asks inline). After start, a wait dialog (Esc/overlay blocked; Dismiss only after countdown or in simulated dev) tells the operator to refresh in ~1–2 minutes. Sidebar “Upgrade now” routes to `/terminal?confirm=upgrade` (does not POST from the rail) and **defers shell WS auth** so operators are not prompted twice. Legacy `?action=upgrade` opens the same confirm, not a fake in-progress state.
- **Resizing**: Bi-directional resize sync between frontend/backend. Resize inputs are validated (cols: 1–500, rows: 1–200) to prevent injection.
- **Persistence**: Auto-reconnect on network drops.
- **Security**:
  - **Double Authentication**: JWT (connect) + Password (interactive).
  - **Rate Limiting**: Max 5 logins/minute.
  - **Session Limits**: Max 3 concurrent connections per user.
  - **Idle Timeout**: Auto-disconnect after 30 minutes of inactivity.

### Graceful Shutdown

The backend handles SIGTERM/SIGINT signals for clean exit:
- Stops accepting new HTTP connections.
- Cleans up all active terminal PTY sessions via `cleanupAllSessions()`.
- Disconnects Prisma database client.
- Applied in: `index.ts`.

## System Logs

**API**: `GET /api/system/logs/:service` (SSE stream)

Mapping lives in `LOG_SERVICE_CONTAINERS` (`backend/src/routes/system.ts`):

| Service | Container | UI label |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| `backend` | `docklift-backend` | Backend |
| `frontend` | `docklift-frontend` | Frontend |
| `nginx` | `docklift-nginx` | Dashboard Gateway (:8080) |
| `proxy` | `docklift-nginx-proxy` | Public Proxy (:80/:443) |
| `certbot` | `docklift-certbot` | Certbot |

## Version Check

**API**: `GET /api/system/version`
- Compares local `package.json` version against GitHub `releases/latest`
- Returns `{ current, latest, updateAvailable, githubOk, checkedAt }`
- TTL: ~15m when update available, ~2m when current, ~30s when GitHub fails —
  never cache a failed probe as “no update” for an hour (that hid new releases)
- Concurrent callers share one GitHub fetch (single-flight). `?refresh=1` revalidates
  only if the cache is older than 30s (not an unconditional bypass).
- UI: sidebar footer only; one shared poller (desktop+mobile rails); no routine `refresh=1`

## Backup & Restore System

All backup/restore routes are in `backend/src/routes/backup.ts`, mounted at `/api/backup`.

### Paths

-   `BACKUP_PATH` defaults to `<DATA_PATH>/backups` (not a hardcoded `/data/backups`).
-   Production/dev Compose set `BACKUP_PATH=/data/backups` with a `./backups` mount.
-   Env names are `DEPLOYMENTS_PATH`, `NGINX_CONF_PATH`, `DOCKER_NETWORK`, `DATA_PATH` (not `DOCKLIFT_*` for those).

### Backup

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `POST /api/backup/create` | Create a full backup (DB, deployments, Nginx configs, GitHub key) |
| `GET /api/backup/list` | List available backups |
| `GET /api/backup/download/:filename` | Download a backup file |
| `DELETE /api/backup/:filename` | Delete a backup |

**SQLite integrity**: create uses `VACUUM INTO` a temp snapshot, then archives that file — never a live
raw copy of `docklift.db`. Missing DB aborts with `[ERROR]` (UI must not toast success).

Frontend streams use `frontend/src/lib/streamProgress.ts`: require `res.ok` and fail on `[ERROR]` lines.

### Restore

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `POST /api/backup/restore/:filename` | Restore from a server-side backup |
| `POST /api/backup/restore-upload` | Upload and immediately restore |
| `POST /api/backup/restore-from-upload/:filename` | Restore from a previously uploaded file |

**Safety**:
-   **`tryAcquireRestoreLock()` before Multer** (`lib/restoreLock.ts`) — concurrent restore → **409**.
    Upload filenames are server-chosen (`restore-<ts>-<random>.zip`), never trusted client names.
-   **Password step-up** for authenticated restores; **setup-token path** for fresh install (no users yet)
    via `setupTokenAuth`.
-   **All three restore routes** track `dbReplaced` and call `rollbackDatabaseFromPreRestore` on later failure.
-   **Commit gate** (`finishRestoreCommit` / `decideRestoreCommit`): consume setup secrets only when
    reconcile succeeds **and** restored DB has `role: 'admin'`. Setup-token + incomplete reconcile →
    abort + roll DB back. If rollback itself fails → **critical seal**:
    - Persist `data/.restore-critical`, hold restore lock, keep maintenance
    - Reload seal on backend boot (`loadRestoreCriticalOnBoot`)
    - Block all `/api/backup/restore*` until `POST /api/backup/clear-critical-restore` (password step-up)
    - Clear must verify the marker is gone before exiting maintenance — deletion failure stays sealed

-   `enterMaintenance()` blocks **all** API traffic except `/api/health` and the active restore stream
    (not just mutating methods).
-   Files/certs/proxy directory swaps are still not fully transactional with the DB.
-   Directory restores use `lib/fsCopy.ts` (`fs.promises.cp` + **content-level** replace inside
    the target) — never shell `cp`, and never `rename` bind-mount roots (`/deployments`,
    `/nginx-conf`, `/etc/letsencrypt`). Staging/prev live under the mount as
    `.docklift-restore-staging-*` / `.docklift-restore-prev-*`. Failed promote or partial
    move-aside restores from prev; orphaned prev dirs are folded in on the next successful replace.
-   Restore does **not** wipe other backup ZIPs.

### Auto-Restore (reconcileSystem)

After restoring files, the system **automatically**:
1. **Reads restored database** — `reconnectPrisma()` then read projects
2. **Recreates persistent volumes** — Each `PersistentVolume` row is re-created as an external
   labelled Docker volume before the project starts, so mounts resolve
3. **Brings every project back up** — `docker compose -f <runtime-compose> -p <composeProject> up -d`,
   where the compose file is `deployments/.docklift/<projectId>/compose.yml` and the project name comes
   from `composeProjectName()`. Older backups without generated runtime state fall back to a
   `docker-compose.yml` at the source root; if neither exists the project is skipped and must be
   deployed manually
4. **Reloads Nginx proxy** — `docker exec docklift-nginx-proxy nginx -s reload`
5. **Self-restarts backend** — `process.exit(0)` triggers Docker's `restart: unless-stopped` policy

Any per-project or nginx failure emits `[ERROR]`; the stream ends with **RESTORE INCOMPLETE** so the
UI does not toast success. Backend still restarts so the restored DB is loaded.

> The `-p` name must match deploy-time naming, or restore creates a *second* set of containers and
> images alongside the originals.

### What's Backed Up

| Item | Path | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Database | `/app/data/docklift.db` | SQLite database |
| Deployments | `/deployments/` | Project source + generated runtime compose |
| Nginx configs | `/nginx-conf/` | Generated proxy configurations |
| Certificates | `/etc/letsencrypt/` | Let's Encrypt certs (backend mounts this RW for restore) |
| GitHub key | `github-app.pem` | GitHub App private key |

Named volume *contents* are not archived — the volumes are re-created empty if missing. Snapshot
application data separately if it matters.

## Install / Upgrade / Uninstall Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `install.sh` | Production install into `/opt/docklift` (default **latest** release). Pin with `bash -s -- v=2.0.2` or `DOCKLIFT_VERSION=2.0.2`. Resolves/validates the tag **before** `compose down`; fails closed if latest API/tag missing (no master fallback). |
| `install-dev.sh` | Same, but from `master` (unreleased code) |
| `upgrade.sh` | Stop backend → SQLite snapshot (`.backup` / copy) → tag `*:pre-upgrade` images → rebuild; rollback uses tagged images + DB restore with backend stopped; health-checks `/api/health` |
| `install.sh` | Prints `Dashboard: http://SERVER_IP:8080` + **Setup code** from `.bootstrap-secret` |
| `uninstall.sh` | Remove DockLift containers, images, volumes, network, build cache and `/opt/docklift` |

`uninstall.sh` targets **DockLift-owned resources only** (core names, `dl_*` / `dl-*`,
`dl-net-*`, `com.docklift.*` labels). Never host-wide `docker system prune` / `builder prune`, and
never remove Docker Engine/git.

## Server Access Requirements

The backend container needs these host-level permissions (defined in `docker-compose.yml`):
- `privileged: true` — required for `nsenter` into host PID 1 (system update / reboot)
- `pid: host` — For host process visibility (reboot, system info)
- Docker socket mount: `/var/run/docker.sock`
- Host file mounts: `/etc/hostname`, `/etc/os-release`, `/proc` (read-only)
- `./nginx-proxy/certbot/conf:/etc/letsencrypt` — read-write, so restores can put certificates back
  (the proxy mounts the same path read-only)

Panel purge must **not** use privileged host maintenance (drop_caches, journal, apt, swap, `/tmp`).
