# Custom Domains & HTTPS

Connect custom domains to the Docklift panel and to deployed services. Certificates come from Let's Encrypt via HTTP-01 (ports **80** and **443** must reach the server).

Domains are the preferred way to expose apps. You do **not** need a published host port for domain traffic — nginx-proxy routes on the project network to `container_name:internal_port`.

## Panel domain

Access Docklift itself via hostname instead of `http://SERVER_IP:8080`.

1. Point a DNS **A record** at your server IP
2. Go to **Settings → Domain**
3. Optionally set the ACME email, then add your domain (e.g. `panel.example.com`)
4. Wait until SSL shows **HTTPS Active** (use Retry if DNS was not ready)

Unknown hostnames on ports 80/443 are rejected — they never fall through to the dashboard.

## Service domains

Each Dockerfile/service can have multiple domains.

1. Go to **Project → Domains**
2. Add a domain for the service (e.g. `api.example.com`)
3. Save — nginx-proxy routes to the container and certbot issues HTTPS

Host ports remain optional under **Build Settings**.

## DNS examples

| Type | Name | Value | Usage |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| `A` | `@` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | Apex (`example.com`) |
| `A` | `panel` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | Docklift panel |
| `A` | `api` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | API service |
| `A` | `*` | `YOUR_SERVER_IP` | Wildcard subdomains |

## Certificate flow

1. Docklift writes an HTTP vhost
2. Certbot solves the ACME HTTP-01 challenge
3. The vhost is rewritten with HTTPS plus an HTTP→HTTPS redirect
4. Renewals run automatically (about every 12 hours). After renew, nginx is reloaded even if the backend was down during the renew (mtime is checked again on startup).

Reordering comma-separated service domains keeps HTTPS on the existing certificate when it already covers every hostname — Docklift resolves the Let's Encrypt `live/` directory by SAN, not only by the first hostname.

**`www` is not added for you.** A certificate order fails entirely if one of its hostnames has no DNS record. Create the `www` DNS record first, then add `www.example.com` as an additional domain.

If issuance fails, check:

```bash
docker logs docklift-certbot --tail 200
```

## Cloudflare

- Prefer DNS-only (gray cloud) while the certificate is first issuing
- After SSL is **Active** in Docklift, set SSL/TLS mode to **Full (strict)**
- Do **not** use Flexible — that sends plain HTTP to your origin
- Ensure Cloudflare can reach `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` over HTTP during issuance

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
|---------|--------|
| `502 Bad Gateway` | Container running? Listening on the configured internal port? |
| Nothing / `NXDOMAIN` | DNS missing or not propagated |
| Cert order fails | One hostname in the request lacks DNS — see certbot logs |
| Panel not on hostname | Use **Settings → Domain**; IP:8080 still works until then |
